# Data-Science-Project-Houses-Prices
## Descretions
<p align="justify"> This project aims to show how to create web applications based on the streamlit library and
  that these can be applicable to real business problems. </p>
<p align="justify"> I used the dataset "kc_house_data" as the data base for building the application in streamlit.</p>
<p align=""> The original dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/swathiachath/kc-housesales-data. </p>
<p align="">Streamlit is a powerful open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share elegant, 
  custom web apps for machine learning and data science </p>
 <p align=""> The commented app code is found in Houses_app https://github.com/RondinellyMorais/Data-Science-Project-Houses-Prices/blob/master/Houses_app.py 
 end we may view the app work in the link https://share.streamlit.io/rondinellymorais/houses-view-app/Houses_deploy.py </p> 
 
 ## Others projects
  <p align=""> I compiled an app to predict whether someone might have heart problems https://github.com/RondinellyMorais/Data-Science-Project-Houses-Prices/tree/master/Heart%20Care%20Streamlit%20App and we may view the app work in the link  https://share.streamlit.io/rondinellymorais/streamlit-app/Heart-care-app.py </p>
  
 <p align=""> Here we have an application that predicts the number of rentals per hour of a company https://github.com/RondinellyMorais/Data-Science-Project-Houses-Prices/tree/master/Bike_Rental_Prediction and we may view the app work in the link https://share.streamlit.io/rondinellymorais/rental_bikes_app/bike_app.py </p>

## business problem
<p align="justify"> In general, when a CEO has to assess which are the best properties to buy and which is the best
  time to buy or sell in order to him have the maximum profit and consequently reduce the probable losses. Even for an experienced business person it is not easy to make the best decision in this regard.</p>
  
  <p align="justify"> Undoubtedly, we can create a data analysis tool that can help in the task of making the best decision. Using a database that consists data of sale and purchase of houses of the city Seattle. I compiled a simple, but powerful python application based on streamlit. </p>
  
   <p align="justify">The application shows various information about the properties and this information can be selected through a series of filters. With this we can have an easy view of the most important attributes. The application also displays an iterative map that allows us to see the density distributions of the houses.</p>
   
   <p align="justify"> The application also allows us to control important information, the variation in house prices over time. It is possible to select a specific period of time where prices are the most favorable for buying or selling. Finally, we can select properties based on number of bathrooms, water view floors and others.</p>
